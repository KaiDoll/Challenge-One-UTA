## First Bootcamp Challenge
**Making the website accessible**

The main changes in HTML was in changing the semantics for example *div* to *header*, *nav*, etc. One of the nav link was not properly linked as it was missing the id. Added the id to make it work. 

The main changes in CSS was in omitting the repeated class and merging them into one.
